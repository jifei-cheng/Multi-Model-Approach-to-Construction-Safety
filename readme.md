### A Multi-Model Approach to Construction Site Safety: Fault Trees, Bayesian Networks, and Ontology Reasoning

### File Structure Description

- **llm_extraction.py**  
  This script provides methods to call two large models, including OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model, Deepseek's chat-reasoner model, and ChatGLM's model. It is used to extract factors related to accident occurrences.

- **machine_learning.py**  
  This script implements the training and prediction of machine learning models, including decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.

- **new-ds.xlsx**  
  A dataset used for comparison experiments, extracted using Deepseek.

- **new-gpt.xlsx**  
  A dataset used for comparison experiments, extracted using OpenAI.

- **Earthwork foundation pit collapse accident.xlsx**  
  A dataset used for training purposes.
